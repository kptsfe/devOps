Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a pod in Kubernetes, create a NodePort service for the pod, and access the application:

Step 1: Create a Pod

To create a pod, you can use the kubectl run command. For example, let's create a pod named my-pod that runs a simple web server using the nginx image:

bash
kubectl run my-pod --image=nginx --port=80

This will create a pod named my-pod that runs a single container using the nginx image and exposes port 80.

Step 2: Verify the Pod

To verify that the pod has been created, you can use the kubectl get pods command:

bash
kubectl get pods

This will list all the pods in your Kubernetes cluster, including the my-pod pod that you just created.

Step 3: Create a NodePort Service

To create a NodePort service for the pod, you can use the kubectl expose command. For example:

bash
kubectl expose pod my-pod --type=NodePort --port=80

This will create a NodePort service that exposes the pod's port 80 to the outside world.

Step 4: Verify the NodePort Service

To verify that the NodePort service has been created, you can use the kubectl get svc command:

bash
kubectl get svc

This will list all the services in your Kubernetes cluster, including the NodePort service that you just created.

Step 5: Access the Application

To access the application, you can use the NodePort number and the IP address of any node in your Kubernetes cluster. For example, let's say that the NodePort number is 30080 and the IP address of a node is 192.168.1.100. You can access the application by visiting the following URL in your web browser:

bash
(link unavailable)

This will access the web server running in the my-pod pod.

Example YAML Files

Here are some example YAML files that you can use to create a pod and a NodePort service:

pod.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

service.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-pod
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30080
  type: NodePort

You can create the pod and the NodePort service using the following commands:

bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml

This will create the pod and the NodePort service, and you can access the application by visiting the URL (link unavailable) in your web browser.
