To install the Apache HTTP Server on CentOS, follow these steps:

 

Update the Package Index:

sudo yum update -y

 

Install Apache:

sudo yum install httpd -y

 

Start and Enable Apache:

sudo systemctl start httpd

sudo systemctl enable httpd

 

Open Firewall Ports: If you are using firewalld, open port 80 (HTTP) and optionally port 443 (HTTPS):

sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http

sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https

sudo firewall-cmd --reload

 

Verify Apache Installation: Open a web browser and navigate to your serverâ€™s IP address. You should see the Apache test page, confirming that Apache is running.

Add Your Content: Place your website files in the /var/www/html/ directory. This is the default document root for Apache.

Configure Apache (Optional): Edit the Apache configuration file located at /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf to customize your server settings.

Restart Apache: After making any changes to the configuration file, restart Apache to apply the changes:

sudo systemctl restart httpd
