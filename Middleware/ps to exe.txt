Here's a simple PowerShell script to get the computer name:

powershell
Copy
Edit
# Get and display the computer name
$computerName = $env:COMPUTERNAME
Write-Host "Computer Name: $computerName"
Explanation:
$env:COMPUTERNAME gets the name of the local computer from environment variables.

Write-Host prints the name to the console.

Let me know if you want to export it to a file or run it remotely.

make above script as .exe file

PowerShell scripts (.ps1) can‚Äôt be directly compiled into .exe files by default, but you can package them into a .exe using tools like PS2EXE. Here's how:

üîß Option 1: Using PS2EXE (Recommended)
‚úÖ Step-by-step:
Install PS2EXE from PowerShell Gallery:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Install-Module -Name ps2exe -Scope CurrentUser
Create your script file (e.g., GetComputerName.ps1):

powershell
Copy
Edit
# GetComputerName.ps1
$computerName = $env:COMPUTERNAME
Write-Host "Computer Name: $computerName"
Convert .ps1 to .exe:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Invoke-PS2EXE -InputFile GetComputerName.ps1 -OutputFile GetComputerName.exe
This will generate GetComputerName.exe in the same directory.

üß∞ Option 2: Use a GUI version (optional)
If you prefer a graphical tool:

Download the GUI version of PS2EXE from GitHub:
https://github.com/MScholtes/PS2EXE

Run ps2exe.ps1 or Win-PS2EXE.ps1 to open a graphical interface for conversion.

Notes:
The resulting .exe runs independently, but still requires PowerShell on the system.

You can set icons, hide the console window, and more with additional parameters.

Would you like me to generate a version of the .ps1 script for download or help with icon customization for the .exe?

how to edit GetComputerName.exe file


ChatGPT said:
You cannot directly edit a .exe file like a text-based .ps1 script. Once you convert a PowerShell script into an .exe using PS2EXE, it becomes a compiled wrapper ‚Äî not human-readable.

üîÅ How to "edit" the .exe (indirectly):
‚úÖ Option 1: Edit the original .ps1 script
Open your original GetComputerName.ps1 file.

Make the desired changes.

Recompile it using PS2EXE:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Invoke-PS2EXE -InputFile GetComputerName.ps1 -OutputFile GetComputerName.exe
üõ†Ô∏è Option 2: Decompile (not recommended or always possible)
There is no guaranteed or official way to reverse .exe files made by PS2EXE back to .ps1. These tools don‚Äôt "compile" the script in the traditional sense ‚Äî they wrap the script in a launcher.

You may try:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Invoke-PS2EXE -Extract -InputFile GetComputerName.exe -OutputFile ExtractedScript.ps1
This might work only if the .exe was built using PS2EXE and had extraction allowed.

üí° Recommendation:
Always keep a copy of your original .ps1 file, and edit that when changes are needed.

Would you like help editing the script or adding features (e.g., save to file, show popup, etc.) before re-compiling?
