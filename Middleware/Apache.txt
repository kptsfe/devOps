Basics:
=======

yum & dnf:
---------
yum (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) is the older package manager.
dnf (Dandified YUM) is the next-generation version of yum, designed to address some of its limitations.
yum is written in Python 2.
dnf is written in Python 3.
In summary, dnf is a more modern, efficient, and reliable package manager compared to yum, and it is the default package manager in newer versions of RHEL and Fedora.

 
apt & dnf:
---------
apt is used in Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu.
dnf is used in Red Hat-based distributions like Fedora and RHEL.
apt commands include apt install, apt remove, apt update, apt upgrade, etc.
dnf commands include dnf install, dnf remove, dnf update, dnf upgrade, etc.
apt is backward compatible with apt-get and apt-cache.
