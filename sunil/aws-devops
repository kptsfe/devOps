The pipe command in Linux, represented by the vertical bar symbol '|'.
The purpose of the pipe command is to connect the output of one command directly into the input of another

The Pipe is a command in Linux that lets you use two or more commands,
 such that output of one command serves as input to the next.

 head -5 f10 | tail -1 

  date | wc -l

-----------------------

Git is  a Version controlling tool  /  SCM  tool.  ( Source code mgmt tool )


Version control systems are tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time.

For almost all software projects, the source code is like the crown jewels - a precious asset whose value must be protected. 

VCS are sometimes known as SCM (Source Code Management) tool.

Most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source tool originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. 

Two types Version Controlloing

The commands :wq! and :q! are used in Vim, a powerful text editor in Unix/Linux. Here's what each does:

✅ :wq! — Write and Quit (Force)
:w = write (save) the file

:q = quit

! = force the action, even if the file is read-only

🟢 Usage:

vim
Copy
Edit
:wq!
Saves the file and exits, even if the file is marked read-only (use with caution).

✅ :q! — Quit Without Saving (Force)
:q = quit

! = force quit even if there are unsaved changes

🟠 Usage:

vim
Copy
Edit
:q!
Exits Vim without saving any changes.

🚫 Do NOT confuse them:
Command	Action
:wq	Save and quit (normal)
:wq!	Force save and quit (e.g., read-only file)
:q	Quit (fails if unsaved changes)
:q!	Force quit without saving

apt & apt-get


ChatGPT said:
apt and apt-get are both command-line tools used on Debian-based Linux distributions (like Ubuntu) for managing packages, but there are some differences in usage and intent.

🔹 apt
Introduced in Ubuntu 16.04 and Debian 8 as a more user-friendly front-end to apt-get, apt-cache, etc.

Meant for end users.

Combines common functionalities of apt-get, apt-cache, and more into a single command.

Provides nicer output formatting and progress bars.

Common apt commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update          # Update package index
sudo apt upgrade         # Upgrade installed packages
sudo apt install pkg     # Install a package
sudo apt remove pkg      # Remove a package
sudo apt search pkg      # Search for a package
sudo apt list --installed # List installed packages
🔹 apt-get
Older and still fully supported.

Meant more for scripts and advanced users.

Offers more granular control, though it may not be as user-friendly.

Common apt-get commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install pkg
sudo apt-get remove pkg
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  # Smarter upgrade, can remove/install packages as needed
✅ Summary
Feature	apt	apt-get
Introduced in	Ubuntu 16.04 / Debian 8	Much earlier
Intended for	End users	Scripts / advanced users
Output	User-friendly with colors	Plain text
Stability	Changes more often	Very stable

You can use either, but prefer apt for day-to-day interactive use and apt-get in scripts or when detailed control is needed.
